# âš½ Football Striker Classification Project

This project applies data analytics and machine learning to classify football strikers based on their performance metrics using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To predict the type of football strikers using various performance metrics and machine learning models, and provide actionable insights for talent identification and performance analysis.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train/Test Split (80/20)
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
A structured dataset containing striker attributes such as:
- Goals Scored
- Assists
- Shots on Target
- Dribbling Success
- Aerial Duels Won
- Defensive Contribution
- Consistency
- Big Game Performance
- Footedness
- Nationality, etc.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

## ðŸ§ª Model Performance
- Achieved **96% accuracy** using Logistic Regression.
- Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
- Identified top-performing striker types using data-driven classification.
- Built a reproducible machine learning pipeline for predictive analysis.
- This model can support real-world decision-making in sports analytics and team strategy.
## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Through this project, we explored how statistical and machine learning techniques can classify football players and extract valuable insights from data â€” a powerful tool for both analysts and football enthusiasts.
